Real Estate Web Scraping and Data Extraction
Overview
This Jupyter notebook contains Python code for web scraping real estate information from a housing website using Selenium and BeautifulSoup. The script scrolls through the webpage, simulating user interaction to load more content, and then extracts relevant details such as property names, prices, flat details, and additional information.

Python
Selenium
BeautifulSoup
Ensure you have the appropriate WebDriver for Selenium, in this case, the Chrome WebDriver.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/pyparul/webscraping_housing.com.git
cd webscraping_housing.com
Install the required dependencies:
